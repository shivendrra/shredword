good at separating bananas from balloons. We need a different variable. Let’s add an axis for roundness. Now we’ve got a two dimensional space with the 
round balloons up here and the banana down here. But if we look at more data we may come 
across a banana that’s pretty round,   and a balloon that isn’t. So maybe there’s some way to measure shininess. Balloons usually have a shiny spot. Now we have a three dimensional space. And ideally, when we get a new image we 
can measure those 3 variables and see   whether it falls in the banana region 
or the balloon region of the space. But what if we want our model to recognize,   not just bananas and balloons, 
but…all these other things. Yellowness, roundness, and shininess don’t 
capture what’s distinct about these objects. That’s what deep learning algorithms do 
as they go through all the training data. They find variables that help improve their
